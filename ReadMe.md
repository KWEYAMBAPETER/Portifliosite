## My Portfolio site
#### Hi, I'm Kweyamba Peter
###### Frontend Developer
I create beautiful, responsive websites with clean code that makes the devil nervous. I don't need anger management; I need people to stop pissing me off. I don't make mistakes. I create unexpected features.


### Who am I?
I love turning ideas into interactive experiences with clean code and thoughtful design. I am passionate about building interfaces that strike a balance between aesthetics, accessibility, and seamless functionalityâ€”where design meets engineering.

When I'm not coding, you can find me hiking, reading tech blogs, or experimenting with new web technologies.


### I have a list of Projects
- The Godlive Project
- The MN Movie ranking Site
- The DreamsTime Project
